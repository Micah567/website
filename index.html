<h1>SPORT AND BOARD GAMES</h1>
<p>Welcome this concludes how to play sports and board games.</p>

<h2>Checkers</h2>

<p>Place your checkers on the <b>the first 3 rows of black squares on a chess board.</b></p>

<p>Checkers can <b>only</b> move diagonally forward. Not straight forward, backwards, sideways or diagonally backwards.</p>

<p> to take checkers you have to be in a position where your checker is in front of your opponents checker and there is a
  empty square behind it you go to the empty space and take the opponents checker</p>
