<h1> HOW TO PLAY BOARD GAMES</h1>
<p>Welcome this concludes how to play  board games.</p>

<h2>Checkers</h2>

<p>Place your checkers on the <b>the first 3 rows of black squares on a chess board.</b></p>

<p>Checkers can <b>only</b> move diagonally forward. Not straight forward, backwards, sideways or diagonally backwards.</p>

<p> to take checkers you have to be in a position where your checker is in front of your opponents checker and there is a
  empty square behind it you go to the empty space and take the opponents checker</p>

  <p>some strategies are try and fill in the space where the opponents checker will jump to.or dont take a checker if a checker will take you.</p>

  <p> to become a king you have to  get to the other side of the borad.then stack a checker on top he checker that made it and it would
    become king now you can go diagonly forward <b>and</b> backwards.kings can be jumped by normal checkers and other  kings to.</p>
  
  <h3>Mancala</h3>
   
   <p>Mancala is a game played in india china brazil nd in most contrys in africa<p/>
  
  <p>start off by putting 4 pieces in each hole but the big bays at the end.
      you and your player pick a side. the bay to the right of you is your bay.and thats were you will be putting your capured pieces.</p>
  
  <p>now dicide whos going to move first .a move is when you pick up each 4 pieces in a hole and then put one in each hole anti clockwise
    in till you run out of picecs.if you go past your bay drop a piece in it.it is optional to drop a stone in your appoinents bay.</p>
  
  <p> if you drop your last piece of your move in a empty hole  on your side 
    then you capure that piece and all of the pieces on the oppist hole.</p>
